TM
- de-static'd TC classes
- desacrated TC code by refomatting it
- unified log printing
- changed directory hierarchy
- merged main config files
- all *NRM treated as normals instead of just *_NRM
- commented unused variables that caused warnings

TODO
- don't crash on missing config file
- don't crash on invalid enums in config
- OVERRIDES {} in the main config file seems to override OVERRIDES {} in other *.tcfg files
